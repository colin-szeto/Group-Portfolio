## Usage of different materials week 8

### Goals

#### Kyle Myint - https://github.com/kylem314/ChessOO/blob/master/AIBot.py

I completed my first 2 goals, spending most of my time this week planning out how to make and AI Chess bot.  More info on that, and what I decided to do is in comments in the file.  I began to gather data that we would need to evaluate moves - so far, I have a list of all of the possible moves that can be made, a dictionary of each of the AI's pieces and their values, and a dictionary of all of the AI's pieces that are being attacked, and which piece is attacking them.

Self-Grade: 23/25 - I figured out a method (that should work) to create a primitive chess AI bot, though it may be a lot of computation and I may have to optimize it in the future.  However, I was unable to finish most of it this week, and will continue working on it in the future.
Scrum Master Grade:  5/5- I think that Kyle meant to put a 19/20 (The remaining 5 points are by meeeeeeee). I am actually amazed that Kyle could put 3 days of researching and 1 day of code and produce a decent model.

#### David Kim
Goals at start of week:
1) Get chess program on a web based server
2) Finish check, checkmate, and stalemate
3) Start working on the logic required for 5d chess
4) Update code to reflect data for 5d chess (even though there would be no way to display it)
5) Maybe figure out how to display the data on a web server

self grade: 17/20
Welp, this wasn't the greatest week of coding for me. With lots of other things to do, I didn't put full effort into putting our project onto html. On Thursday, I realized that even though our formatting cannot be standardized, I should still be trying to figure out the data. Due to my stupidity, I got much less done than I would've wished, mainly by being stuck on step 1. After sacking that, I logiced out check, checkmate, and stalemate, and now I just need to put it into code. I did get started on the check code, and checkmate/stalemate should work. I figured out the basics of how I want to store data for 5d chess, and I did make a fork off of the original code, but there isn't much different. We did make sure that we could use intellij, and I, at least, have transferred over fully from repl.

Scrum Master Grade:  _/5

#### Colin Szeto 
Goals at start of week:
1. render multiple chess boards
2. Be able to take inputs and have the computer respond to the inputs	by editing dictionaries

I focused on Goal 2 to show mastery of jinja as provided on the 10/28/20 lecutre. I was unable to complete goal 1. 
implmentation of data file, I store the list which is used to display all of the sums that were calculated in the addition tab: https://bit.ly/3ecZSJb
able to use the form tag to recieve inputs from user: https://bit.ly/2TGBk1G
implement jinja for loops to print out all contents of list: https://bit.ly/2HSgFFb

example on using DOM to call for specific JS functions: https://bit.ly/37VGuPO
here is where the JS function is stored to communicate to the player what piece is stored:https://bit.ly/3edlFQY
here is what the player sees: https://bit.ly/2TDcQGy

self grade: 18/20
I can improve on organizing the team more on the journals. For the future I will want to get the forms and DOM to interface together to provide the player with the option of of dragable pieces as the UI. I hope to implement Jinja dictonaries to store the values of the chessboard and hope to pass it into js scripts to then convert them into interactive ui for the user. 
Scrum Master Grade:  5/5- Based on code, seems like good progress made through the week. I feel like he graded himself a bit harsh. 
 
#### Shekar Krishnamoorthy
Goals at start of week: My goals were to fix the existing code for the chess game and it implement a new user password code. Due to our original transfer from repl to intellij, some code got messed up. An improved username password system will be compatible with a web based code and allow 2 users to log in from different computers and play together
self grade: 18/20: David and I both fixed the original code by removing and changeing parts that were working on repl but not working on intellij. We both had to push the code a lot of times until all the parts worked together to make functioning code. The only parts that are not working are the parts that we are woking on and improving for the new project idea. For the second goal, I didn't expect I would get it this week, since I would have to make a completely new interactive website which would be connected to Colin's java chess project on flask, but I didn't make too much progress on it. Other than research and a small improvement to the flask and intelliJ parts of the project, the interactive 2 player website wasn't finished at all. I hope to do more next week and maybe have at least one interactive aspect for 2 players to play on the chess game. Here is what I used - https://pusher.com/tutorials/game-python-vue
Scrum Master Grade:  5/5- Helped the team regroup at times we were working independtently instead of as a team. Was more focused on assignment requirements than the new code, but it proved to be helpful for the team

#### Devam Shrivastava
Goals at start of week:
1. My only sole goal was to work with Kyle and get the Chess AI Bot up and running. I was expecting it to be quite time straining.

self grade:  17/20- I set my only goal to be to work on the AI piece since I expected that to take most of my time. As expected it did. I looked through many sources online on how to create the bot. In the end, I came up with a model, but didn't seem to work, so I collaborated with Kyle on his design of the single-player bot. I made some efficiency changes to the code, and tried to use a bit more classes in my new designs. Overall, I am lowering my grade since I failed in producing a working model, but I did help out in editing the code as I found some errors. I have commited and pushed any edits I have into my own branch rather than the master branch in order to stay away from any merging collisions.
Scrum Master Grade:  4/5- Could have been better with communication.


##### template

1.  Expectations are links to code.. My suggestion is README and Code, let porfolio, project and tangible artifacts do the talkin'.
2. 20 of 25 points by student and pair on goals, artifacts, and updates to journal.
3. 5 of 25 points by Scrum Master, Scrum master should be brief in award, should be based on artifacts produced and goals.
