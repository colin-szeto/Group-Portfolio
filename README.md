This is the Flask Web Group Portfolio by Colin Szeto, David Kim, Shekar Krishnamoorthy, Kyle Myint, Devam Shrivatsava

We designed our home screen using styling in the home page tab, with all necessary items to navigate to important parts of our project
We implemented code featuring all of our journals in the journals tab
We are inputting our chess code in the chess table tab
We put in individual html projects that we experimented with for the purpose of chess, in the Chess with JS, the addition, and the chess final push tabs

David and Kyle: for the best few weeks, they worked on an AI bot, an imporvement to the chess game we built. (david and kyle explain the code here)
Shekar worked on adjusting the portfolio website to be more efficient and organized. By styling the home page and journal page better, we were able to display the project plan, the github, and the journals better. I also embedded the journals onto the journals tab and improved the jinja navbar by making the file paths easier to follow.

# Here are the items that need to be included
There should be Project (README) notes and Journal notes on Development, Deployment, and Hosting.  These notes would be helpful to any new member of your team.  You should consider that 50% of your SCRUM team and Pairs/Trios will be disrupted in Trimester 2.
